- The idea behind this project is to see if machine learning can be useful for prediction soccer matches ( in this case the premier league).
- *Is still a work in progress since there a lot of ways to collect and filter the data, I'm still trying to see if there is a better way, so the overall accuracy can be improved since it was between 50% and 60%. However, since is a team sport there is a bunch of things that can be predicted so domain knowledge actualy helped.

- The season considered was from 2017-2018 to today  (10/27/2022)
